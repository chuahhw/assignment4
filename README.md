<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>After attending this industrial talk, the information that I learn is about the history of TM and how Credence is formed. I also learned the technology and tools that were used in Credence system development. I think the speaker was very good, no improvements needed. I like that she also share her experience about being a data engineering student in UTM. In my opinion, I think that Credence is a good system because it provides a range of database management tools such as PostgresSQL, ClickHouse, and Druid.</p>
