<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>After attending this industrial talk, the information that I learn is about the benefits of innovation in human life. I-Farrm enables people to order fresh vegetables nearby in every residental area and letting people farm and purchase the vegetable they choose. The improvement that i suggest is I hope the speaker can show some videos about how the user of I-Farm plants plant their own vegetables. In my opinion, I think that i will use I-Farm in the future if I have a chance because by using I-Farm, I don't need to go out to the market to buy vegetables. It can help me save time and energy. </p>
